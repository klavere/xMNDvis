This repository includes all **Jupyter Notebooks** used for my Master's Thesis titled  **"Visualizing Mobile Network Data â€“ A User-Centred Design Approach Connecting Visual Analytics to Urban Public Transportation Planning"**.
To use them, download the whole repository and add the flow and OD data from **mCloud** (link will follow) in the folders *data/flows_with_mode* and *data/OD_with_mode*.
Each notebook contains a description of the code.
